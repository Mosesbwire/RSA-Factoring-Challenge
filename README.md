## RSA FACTORING

The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem.

The algorithm is used for data encryption, setting digital sigatures and for key exchange.

The RSA algorithm is asymmetric, the encryption key is different from the decryption key.

The public key is known by everyone and is used for the encryption, while the private key used for decryption is only known by the owner.

The public key can be compared to an individuals post office box number that can be shared with individuals the person wishes to communicate with.

The private key is the owners key used to access the mail box. Only them have the key for their box office.

It is therefore essential to keep the private key safe and secure to inorder to maintain the integrity of the system.
